Input data required for successfully running Iterative GPS-Rosetta:
-


* 1. Generate fragment files. </br>

See folder "./robetta_inputs", for required input files to generate initial fragment libraries. </br>
Exclusion of homologous fragments depends on your modelling case. For Iterative GPS-Rosetta, it doesn't matter, just needs to run longer if homologous are excluded. </br>

* 2. Setup </br>

see folder "./setup" for setting up experimental PCS data. The PCS data should be in a particular format. </br>
The chemical-tag geometry (or) Possible metal positions relative to the protein, that could be sampled by the geometry of the tag, should be specified through a broker file. Also, PCSs from different tags can be defined in the broker file. </br>


* 3. GPS Rosetta </br>
